### Best Practices

We have a special section of curated industry best practices in MDD. 

To add your best practice:

1. **Create a New Meme Entry**: Add your best practice to `./src/memes/memes.ts` along with your meme image to `./src/memes/`.
2. **Submit a Pull Request**: Submit a PR, remembering to follow the MDD specification for PRs
3. **Profit**: After a short review cycle your best practice will now be definitively an industry best practice.
