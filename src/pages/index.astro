        <div>
          Meme Driven Development (MDD) aims to foster a creative and engaging
          environment for software development. 
        </div>

        <div>By integrating humor and visual
          communication, MDD enhances team collaboration and makes the
          development process more enjoyable.
        </div>

        <div>
          We are uncovering better ways of developing software by creating and
          sharing memes.
        </div>

        <div>Through this work, we have come to value:</div>

        <ul class="list-none mb-8 space-y-4 ml-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Memes over Documentation</strong><br />
            That is, while there is value in comprehensive documentation, we value
            the creativity and engagement that memes bring more.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Humor over Formality</strong><br />
            That is, while formal communication has its place, we find that humor
            fosters a more collaborative and enjoyable environment.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Visual Feedback over Textual Feedback</strong><br />
            That is, while textual feedback is useful, we believe that visual feedback
            through memes is more impactful and memorable.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Team Spirit over Individual Effort</strong><br />
            That is, while individual contributions are important, we prioritize
            the collective spirit and camaraderie that memes help build.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="text-xl font-bold">Principles behind the Meme Driven Development Manifesto</div>

        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 ml-5">
          <li>
            Our highest priority is to satisfy the team through early and
            continuous delivery of memes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Welcome changing memes, even late in development. Memes harness
            change for the team's advantage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deliver memes frequently, from a couple of times a day to a couple
            of times a week, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
          </li>
          <li>
            Business people and developers must work together daily throughout
            the project, sharing and enjoying memes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the
            environment and support they need, and trust them to create great
            memes.
          </li>
          <li>
            The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to
            and within a development team is face-to-face conversation,
            supplemented by memes.
          </li>
          <li>Memes are the primary measure of progress.</li>
          <li>
            Meme Driven Development promotes sustainable development. The
            sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a
            constant pace indefinitely.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continuous attention to meme quality and meme design enhances
            agility.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simplicity‚Äîthe art of maximizing the amount of meme not done‚Äîis
            essential.
          </li>
          <li>The best memes emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
          <li>
            At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
            effective, then tunes and adjusts its meme creation and sharing
            accordingly.

        <div>
            Meme Driven Development (MDD) is a novel approach to software
            development derived from popular legacy methadologies like Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD).
        </div>

        <div>In MDD, developers are required to create and share memes before writing any code. 
          Additionally, feedback on pull requests and other forms of communication must be delivered in meme form. 
          This specification outlines the conventions and practices for adopting MDD in a development workflow.

              <li>
                <strong>Purpose</strong>: Memes should encapsulate the essence of
                the task or problem at hand.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Format</strong>: Memes can be in the form of images, GIFs,

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Content</strong>: Memes must be relevant, respectful, and

              <li>
                <strong>Requirement</strong>: Before any coding begins, a meme must
                be created and shared with the team.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Approval</strong>: The meme must receive at least one

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Documentation</strong>: The meme should be documented in the

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Clarity</strong>: Memes should clearly convey the feedback,
                whether it is approval, a request for changes, or highlighting an
                issue.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Constructiveness</strong>: Memes must be constructive and
